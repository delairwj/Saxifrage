		<li id="1"> Once upon at time, Little Red Hen lived with her chicks on a beautiful farm.
		<li> The barnyard was full of lots of animals,
		<li> but her very best friends were the duck, the pig, and the cat.
		<li> Little Red Hen worked hard to feed her family. Every morning she gathered her chicks together and went out into the barnyard to look for something to eat.
		<li> One morning, Little Red Hen found some grains of wheat. She thought, "If I plant this wheat, it will grow tall and golden. It will make good bread, and there will be plenty for all to eat."
		<li> Little Red Hen said to her friends, "Who will help me plant this wheat so that it will grown and all may eat?"
		<li>"I've already got plans," said the duck. "I'm going to be very busy this afternoon," said the cat. The pig just shrugged his shouldes and went about the barnyard.
		<li>So little Red Hen said, "I will plant these grains." And she did.
		<li>Soon the wheat began to grow, and Little Red Hen took loving care of it. She pulled the weeds and loosened the soil. When it didn't rain, she watered it. The wheat kept on growing until it was tall, golden, ripe and mature.
		<li>Finally the day came to cut the wheat. Little Red Hen said to her friends, "Who will help me cut this wheat?"
		<li>"I'm too busy," said the duck. "I can't," said the cat. The pig just shrugged his shoulders and went about the barnyard.
		<li>So Little Red Hen said, "I will cut this wheat." And she did.
		<li>Then it was time to thresh the grain - to seperate the wheat from the straw. It was and easy, but tedious task. Little Red Hen thought it woudl be more enjoyable if her friends helped. So she said, "Who will help me thresh this wheat?"
		<li>"Don't count on me," said the duck. "Sorry," said the cat. The Pig just shrugged his shoulders and went about the barnyard.
		<li>So Little Red Hen said, "I will do it." And she did.
		<li>Little Red Hen put all the wheat into the wheelbarrow so that she could take it to the mill to be ground into flour. The wheelbarrow was very heavy.
		<li>Little Red Hen said to her friends, "Who will help me carry this wheat to the mill?"
		<li>"I've got more important things to do," said the duck. "I'm busy too," said the cat, "so not us." The pig just shrugged his shoulders and went about the barnyard.
		<li>So Little Red Hen said, "I will do it." And she did.
		<li>By and by, Little Red Hen came back with the flour. She went into the kitchen and got out all the ingredients to make some bread. Little Red Hen liked to bake bread, but she thought it woudl be more fun if her friends helped too. So she said, "Who will help me bake this bread?"
		<li>"Some other time," said the duck. "Not today," said the cat. The pig just shrugged his shoulders and went about the barnyard.
		<li>So Little Red Hen said, "I will do it." And she did.
		<li>She put the bread into the oven. As it baked, the sweet smell of bread filled the kitchen and drifted out over the barnyard. All the animals could smell it. Little Red Hen said, "Who will help me eat this bread?"
		<li>"I will," said the duck!"<sup>2</sup>
		<br>"I will," said the cat!
		<br>"I will," said the pig!
		<li>So she opened the door and invited them in. They all sat down at the table. Little Red Hen blessed the bread, broke it, and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened.
